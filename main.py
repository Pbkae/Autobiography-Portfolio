        In my early days, I truly valued sleep (hahaha). As a baby, I seemed to enjoy it so much that I kept on sleeping. I was a curious and mischievous 
        child, always fascinated by the little things. According to my father, I would ask odd or unusual questions due to my vivid imagination (which is 
        still very much alive today).

        I was a pretty bright kid, if I do say so myself. I earned honors and did well in English, math, and science from a young age, although I struggled 
        with Filipino‚Äîironically, since I‚Äôm a pure-blooded Filipina.

        Despite these achievements, my mischievous side remained strong. One memorable incident from kindergarten involved me and a classmate goofing around 
        before the teacher arrived. It involved a stroller bag, and I ended up dragging my classmate around the classroom in it. We were eventually caught, 
        and as punishment, our bags were hung from the flagpole (hahaha).

            online classes during the lockdown, adjusting to the new digital environment was challenging. We had to quickly learn to use various online 
            platforms for classes, assignments, and trying to simulate university life virtually.

            It was particularly tough for me because I started a program in IT with no prior programming knowledge. I didn‚Äôt have friends from high school 
            in the same field, as most of them went to different universities, leaving me to navigate this new world on my own. Despite the challenges, I 
            managed to get through it (somehow, haha). Outside of academics, I spent more time with my family, which helped me stay grounded and find

            By sophomore year, I started making a few acquaintances and was gradually grasping the concepts of programming and its foundations. CIT-U adapted 
            quickly to the online environment, and both students and professors became well-adjusted to the platforms we were using. By this point, everything 
            seemed much easier.

            However, it was also during this time that I began experiencing what I now recognize as "Imposter Syndrome." I felt mentally drained and started 
            questioning why I chose this program, even considering shifting to another course. I kept comparing myself to others and felt like I was falling 
            behind. What kept me going was the support and encouragement from my parents, my brothers cheering me on, and advice from a senior I had connected 
            with, who told me, "In this course, you can't survive alone. It's okay to ask questions."

            With that in mind, I allowed myself "to be a beginner" and, despite my introverted nature, started reaching out to classmates and schoolmates I didn‚Äôt 
            know. I began asking how they tackled certain topics, seeking advice, and connecting with peers to share our struggles. Before long, I noticed that many 
            of the concepts I had struggled with before became easier.

            I learned that it's okay to struggle with something new‚Äîthat‚Äôs normal. Like a baby learning to walk, it takes time. The key is to be consistent and keep 
            practicing because practice leads to improvement, even if not perfection.

            Junior year was intense but incredibly rewarding. I took on leadership roles in various clubs, including the Google Developer Student Club, Computer Students' Society,

            This was also the year that sparked my passion for cybersecurity. The curriculum introduced topics related to it, opening my eyes to this exciting field. I began self-learning, 
            reading beyond what was taught in class, and diving deeper into cybersecurity. Although I was still new to the topics and struggled with some of the concepts, I continued to push 
            forward, even without knowing others who shared my interest at the time.

            Balancing academics and student leadership made this the most stressful year for me. Late-night meetings, event planning, a bit of drama, and managing projects all made it hectic. 
            However, looking back now, it was incredibly fulfilling to see the results of my efforts. This year helped me grow not only as a student but also as a person. I made lifelong friends, 
            gained valuable skills, learned important lessons, and created lasting memories. It was truly a year worth remembering.
